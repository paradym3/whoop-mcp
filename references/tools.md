# Tools, Resources and Prompts

[Back to README](../README.md)

## Tools

Standard mode exposes these 16 read-only tools with validated inputs and outputs.
Scores may be pending/unscored and optional measurements unavailable; missing
values are not zero. Aggregate mode exposes only the five tools listed in
[Structured Results And Privacy](privacy.md#structured-results-and-privacy).

The four collection tools return **one page**, default limit 10, maximum 25.
Pass the response's `next_token` as the next call's `nextToken`. Analytics fetch
multiple pages internally within their limits. Collection `start` is inclusive
and `end` exclusive; omitted bounds use WHOOP defaults. Supply both bounds for
a specific historical period:

```json
{"start":"2026-09-01T00:00:00Z","end":"2026-09-08T00:00:00Z","limit":25}
```

### `get_profile`

Get the authenticated user's ID, name and email. This is identifying data;
avoid including results in public logs or issue reports.

**Parameters:** None

---

### `get_body_measurement`

Get the user's body measurements: height in metres, weight in kilograms, and
maximum heart rate in beats per minute.

**Parameters:** None

---

### `get_recovery_collection`

Get recovery records for a date range. Scored records include HRV and resting
heart rate; SpO2 and skin temperature can be unavailable.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `start` | string | No | ISO 8601 or relative expression ("today", "last 7 days", "this week"). |
| `end` | string | No | ISO 8601 or relative expression. Defaults to now. |
| `limit` | number | No | Max records to return (1–25). Defaults to 10. |
| `nextToken` | string | No | Pagination token from a previous response. |

---

### `get_sleep_collection`

Get main sleeps and naps for a date range. Scored records include stage durations
in milliseconds, sleep need and available respiratory/performance measures.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|

| `nextToken` | string | No | Pagination token from a previous response. |

---

### `get_workout_collection`

Get workout records for a date range. Scored records include strain, heart-rate
zones, energy in kilojoules and sport name. Distance/elevation may be unavailable.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `start` | string | No | ISO 8601 or relative expression ("today", "last 7 days", "this week"). |
| `end` | string | No | ISO 8601 or relative expression. Defaults to now. |
| `limit` | number | No | Max records to return (1–25). Defaults to 10. |
| `nextToken` | string | No | Pagination token from a previous response. |

---

### `get_cycle_collection`

Get physiological cycles for a date range, including scored strain, kilojoules
and heart rates. The current open cycle can have a null end timestamp.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `start` | string | No | ISO 8601 or relative expression ("today", "last 7 days", "this week"). |
| `end` | string | No | ISO 8601 or relative expression. Defaults to now. |
| `limit` | number | No | Max records to return (1–25). Defaults to 10. |
| `nextToken` | string | No | Pagination token from a previous response. |

---

### `get_sleep_by_id`

Get a single sleep record in the same provider shape as the sleep collection.
Optional measurements and scoring status still apply.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Yes | Sleep record ID; letters, digits, hyphens and underscores only. |

---

### `get_workout_by_id`

Get a single workout record in the same provider shape as the workout collection,
including scored strain, heart-rate zones and kilojoules.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Yes | Workout record ID; letters, digits, hyphens and underscores only. |

---

### `get_cycle_by_id`

Get a single physiological cycle, including scored strain, kilojoules and heart
rates. An open cycle may not have an end timestamp.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | number | Yes | Positive integer cycle record ID. |

---

### `get_weekly_summary`

Get a UTC-grouped weekly report: average recovery, HRV, RHR, sleep duration and
quality, workout count and strain, plus recovery trend direction. An incomplete
week summarizes only available records; it is not a prediction.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `week_start` | string | No | ISO 8601 or relative expression ("last week", "this week"). Defaults to most recent Monday. |

---

### `compare_periods`

Compare observed recovery, sleep and strain between two explicit periods.
Differences describe the available data, not causation or clinical improvement.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `period_a_start` | string | Yes | ISO 8601 start of the first period. |
| `period_a_end` | string | Yes | ISO 8601 end of the first period. |
| `period_b_start` | string | Yes | ISO 8601 start of the second period. |
| `period_b_end` | string | Yes | ISO 8601 end of the second period. |

---

### `get_trend`

Analyze one metric's direction, variability and anomalies using linear regression.
Interpret labels alongside sample counts and missing days, not as a diagnosis.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `metric` | string | Yes | One of: `recovery`, `hrv`, `rhr`, `sleep_duration`, `sleep_performance`, `strain`. |
| `days` | number | No | Number of days to analyze (7–90). Default: 30. |

---

### `get_today`

Get a best-available current health snapshot: recovery, primary sleep, strain
and last workout. Partial or stale sources are identified rather than described
as a guaranteed complete picture of today.

**Parameters:** None

**Returns:** Recovery score with zone, sleep breakdown (hours, stages, performance), current strain, last workout (sport + strain), and a human-readable summary.

Recovery is returned only when it matches the current local cycle and primary sleep.
Pending or invalid primary sleep never falls back to an older recovery. Missing optional
sleep percentages are `null`, not zero. `data_quality` distinguishes missing, pending,
stale, unscored, calibrating, invalid and failed sources; cache status and fetch time
remain unknown when the client cannot establish them.

For compatibility, `sleep.total_hours` remains time in bed. Use `time_in_bed_hours`
or `asleep_hours` explicitly; summaries now use scored asleep stages. The latest
workout includes `occurred_at` and recording percentage and may be historical.

---

### `get_baselines`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `baseline_days` | integer | No | History window, 14-180; default 30. |

Returns personal distributions for HRV, resting heart rate, respiratory rate,
asleep hours and recovery score. `baseline_days` is an integer from 14 to 180
(default 30). Each band includes mean, median, standard deviation, percentiles,
sample size and the latest observation's midrank percentile.

The latest observation and current local day are excluded from each baseline.
Calibrating, unscored, invalid and unjoinable observations are excluded. A metric
needs 14 historical points after exclusions; otherwise its band is null with an
insufficient-data status. Constant distributions are labeled explicitly.

### `get_sleep_debt`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `days` | integer | No | Window length, 3-90; default 14. |
| `start` | string | No | ISO 8601 or relative expression; begins a forward window. |

Analyzes scored main sleeps using `days` (3-90, default 14) and optional `start`
(ISO or a supported relative expression). With `start`, the window extends forward
for `days` calendar days, clamped to evaluation time. Resolved bounds are returned.

`total_debt_hours` sums observed nightly deficits. Need excludes WHOOP's accumulated
debt component and preserves the signed nap adjustment; achieved sleep is light +
slow-wave + REM. `standing_debt_hours` is the latest WHOOP debt value, separately
dated, not the deficit sum. Missing nights are not zero-sleep nights; fewer than
three usable nights returns null aggregates. Circular local-clock statistics describe
consistency and heuristic social jetlag, not clinical diagnoses or recovery forecasts.

Analytics paginate up to 500 records per source and report upstream truncation.
Sleep-debt calculations use all selected records but echo at most 30 nights, with
a separate `output_capped` flag. Both tools include a statistical/medical disclaimer.

### `get_calendar`

Get a UTC day-by-day grid of recovery, sleep and strain, with period averages.
Missing days remain distinct from measured zero values.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `days` | number | No | Number of days to show (1–90). Default: 7. |
| `start` | string | No | ISO date or supported expression. With `start`, iterate forward for `days`, clamped to today; otherwise use a trailing window. |

**Returns:** Per-day grid with recovery score + zone (green/yellow/red), sleep hours, sleep performance, and strain. Includes period averages.

---

## Supported Date Expressions

The four collection tools, `get_calendar`, `get_sleep_debt.start` and
`get_weekly_summary.week_start` accept supported relative expressions
(case-insensitive). `compare_periods` requires explicit ISO bounds;
`get_trend` takes a day count.

| Expression | Example Result |
|------------|----------------|
| `"today"` | Today's UTC day boundaries |
| `"yesterday"` | Yesterday's UTC day boundaries |
| `"last N days"` (1–365) | N days back from today |
| `"last N weeks"` (1–52) | N×7 days back from today |
| `"last N months"` (1–12) | N calendar months back |
| `"this week"` | Monday to today |
| `"last week"` | Previous Monday–Sunday |
| `"this month"` | 1st of month to today |
| `"last month"` | Full previous month |
| `"this quarter"` | Quarter start (Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct) to today |
| `"last quarter"` | Full previous quarter |
| `"last year"` | Jan 1–Dec 31 of previous year |
| `"YYYY-MM"` (e.g., `"2026-05"`) | Full calendar month |
| ISO 8601 | Pass-through (e.g., `"2026-03-15T00:00:00Z"`) |

Relative bounds use UTC. A collection `start` expression supplies its lower bound,
not an implicit matching `end`; pass both for a bounded historical query.
These rules do not change local-day attribution inside personal analytics.

## Resources

In standard mode, clients can read these four JSON resources without invoking a
tool. “Latest” is the most recent provider record, not necessarily today or fully
scored. Use `get_today` for current-cycle matching and data-quality flags.

| Resource URI | Description | Cache TTL |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| `whoop://v2/user/recovery/latest` | Most recent recovery score, HRV, RHR | 5 min |
| `whoop://v2/user/sleep/latest` | Most recent sleep record | 5 min |
| `whoop://v2/user/cycle/latest` | Most recent physiological cycle (strain) | 2 min |
| `whoop://v2/user/profile` | User profile (name, email) | 1 hr |

**Privacy:** Resources expose the same data available through tools — they simply make it accessible as ambient context. No additional WHOOP scopes are required. Data is cached in-memory with short TTLs and invalidated on token refresh.

To disable resources: set `WHOOP_MCP_DISABLE_RESOURCES=1`.

---

## Caching

Selected internal read requests opt into a shared in-memory LRU/TTL cache.
Resources use it; an identical path and normalized query can reuse an entry.
Different queries do not share records automatically, and composite tool results
are not themselves cached. There is no persistent health-data database.

| Data | TTL |
|------|-----|
| Profile | 1 hr |
| Recovery, Sleep | 5 min |
| Cycle | 2 min |
| Collections (date-range queries) | Uncached |

- Cache keys are normalized by request path with sorted query params; **no tokens are ever part of a cache key**.
- Concurrent identical requests are de-duplicated (single in-flight fetch — stampede prevention).
- The entire cache is cleared on token refresh.
- Restarting the process discards the cache. Raw collection requests do not
  automatically reuse cached resource responses.

---

## Write Operations

The server registers no WHOOP create/update/delete tools. The internal
[`withPreview()` helper](../src/tools/write-safety.ts) is a future implementation
scaffold, not an exposed preview/confirm command or a shipped write workflow.
This describes the package's scope, not every capability of the WHOOP platform.

---

## Prompts

Standard mode exposes five named templates through MCP `prompts/list` and
`prompts/get`. Client support determines how they are presented; typing the same
words into chat is not necessarily a template request. Aggregate mode hides them.

| Prompt | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `weekly_health_review` | Comprehensive review of recovery, sleep, and workouts (accepts optional `days` arg) |
| `sleep_analysis` | Analyze recent sleep patterns and quality |
| `recovery_trend` | How is recovery trending? HRV, RHR, recovery score analysis |
| `workout_recap` | Summarize recent workouts, strain, and training load |
| `health_check` | Quick health status using cached resource data |

With telemetry consent, a successful template retrieval records only its name
and success outcome, never arguments, template text or conversation content.
Listing is not counted. Retrieval itself does not fetch WHOOP data.
