# Development and Releases

[Back to README](../README.md)

## Development

Use Node >=20 for the npm client, or Node >=22 when working on the separate
collector/dashboard package. Tests mock WHOOP; automated checks must never use
real account data. Run the client and collector suites below for the current
checkout's test results; release-specific verification belongs in the changelog.

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shashankswe2020-ux/whoop-mcp.git
cd whoop-mcp
npm ci
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run build` | Build TypeScript |
| `npm test` | Run mocked client tests (Vitest 4) |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run tests with coverage |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type check (`tsc --noEmit`) |
| `npm run lint` | Lint (ESLint) |
| `npm run lint:fix` | Lint + auto-fix |
| `npm run format` | Format (Prettier) |
| `npm run format:check` | Verify configured source formatting |
| `npm run dev` | Run in dev mode (tsx) |
| `npm audit` | Audit all client dependencies, including development tools |

The collector is a separate private package, not included in the npm client:

```bash
npm --prefix collector ci
npm --prefix collector test
npm --prefix collector run typecheck
npm --prefix collector run lint
npm --prefix collector run format:check
npm --prefix collector run build
npm --prefix collector run build:dashboard
npm --prefix collector audit
```

Both collector builds are local dry runs; deployment requires separately configured
Cloudflare infrastructure. See [operator documentation](../collector/README.md).
The [public site](../site/index.html) is standalone HTML, deployed from `site/` by
the [Pages workflow](../.github/workflows/pages.yml).
The production domain is [whoopconnector.com](https://whoopconnector.com/),
configured in the repository's Pages settings. Because publishing uses GitHub
Actions, a `CNAME` file is not used. At Hostinger, the apex (`@`) A records point
to `185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, `185.199.110.153` and `185.199.111.153`;
`www` is a CNAME to `shashankswe2020-ux.github.io`. Preserve unrelated mail and
verification records when changing DNS. Keep HTTPS enforcement enabled once
GitHub has provisioned the domain certificate.

Its light product-story layout includes a scroll-driven illustrative band,
example analytics, a privacy-mode preview and keyboard-accessible client setup
tabs. The page loads pinned Three.js 0.160.0 modules from jsDelivr for the band
and fonts from Google Fonts; these are browser-only and do not change the MCP
package dependencies. No telemetry client is loaded. Reduced-motion, disabled
JavaScript and unavailable WebGL use a static overview instead.

Preview `site/` with a local static HTTP server (no frontend build is required).
Check the layout at 320, 768, 1024 and 1440 pixels, scroll through the story,
try band colors and privacy modes, and verify setup tabs with arrow keys,
Home and End. Confirm copy success/failure announcements and test with reduced
motion, JavaScript disabled and the 3D CDN blocked. `npm test --
tests/public-metadata.test.ts` checks metadata and the static page contract.

The project-activity strip contains total npm downloads since the package's first
publication on April 11, 2026, and the repository's current GitHub star count.
The Pages workflow refreshes this HTML on deployment and daily at 06:17 UTC
(scheduled runs may be delayed by GitHub). Visitors make no statistics API
requests; the dated counts also work without JavaScript.

Run `npm run site:stats` to refresh the local snapshot and `npm run site:check`
to type-check its generator. The generator requests explicit dates through the
previous UTC day, avoiding stale cached rolling-period responses, and sums
non-overlapping one-year windows to stay within npm's 18-month API limit.
Upstream npm totals can lag or be revised. All responses are validated.
The optional `GITHUB_TOKEN` is sent only to
GitHub. Failed requests or incomplete ranges stop the deployment, leaving the
previous site and its explicitly dated counts intact rather than publishing zero
or partial totals. The daily job changes only the deployment artifact, not git.

## Releases & npm Package

This project is published on npm as [`whoop-ai-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/whoop-ai-mcp).

```bash
npm install -g whoop-ai-mcp@latest
```

Or run directly with `npx`:

```bash
npx -y whoop-ai-mcp@latest
```

The server command needs WHOOP credentials; use `setup` for configuration first.
Review the changelog before upgrading. For a global installation, rerun
`npm install -g whoop-ai-mcp@latest`, then restart the client. The `@latest` and
unversioned wizard-generated launch entries resolve npm's latest dist-tag on
launch; inspect the actual launched version when diagnosing issues.

### Release Process

1. Synchronize `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `server.json` and the changelog.
2. Pass tests, lint, typecheck, formatting, build, package inspection and full
  dependency audits, including collector checks when affected. Review and merge
  only the intended changes; leave unrelated working-tree edits out.
3. Tag the approved merge commit `vX.Y.Z` and push that tag.
4. Verify the [Release workflow](../.github/workflows/release.yml) creates the correct
  GitHub release and changelog notes.
5. Verify the [npm publish workflow](../.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml) runs for
  the same commit. Releases created by `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not trigger downstream
  release workflows; use its manual dispatch on the approved tag when necessary.
6. Confirm the npm version/dist-tag and smoke-test the published artifact.
  Registry propagation can lag a successful upload; do not blindly republish.
  Verify MCP Registry metadata and Pages deployment separately.

### Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) for a full list of changes in each release.
