**whoop-ai-mcp** is a read-only [WHOOP](https://www.whoop.com/)
[MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for Claude Desktop, Claude Code,
Codex and GitHub Copilot. Ask about your recovery, compare weeks of sleep, or
explore your personal baseline without exporting and assembling the data yourself.

## Ask More of Your WHOOP Data

| Start with a question | Explore |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **"How am I doing today?"** | Recovery, primary sleep, strain and your latest workout, with missing-data flags. |
| **"Is my HRV unusual for me?"** | Personal baseline distributions, percentiles and sample counts. |
| **"How did my sleep change this month?"** | Trends, period comparisons, observed sleep deficits and consistency. |
| **"Give me my weekly health review."** | Recovery, sleep and training summaries through one conversation. |

Statistics describe your recorded history, not medical diagnoses or predictions.

## Quickstart

You need Node.js 20+, an active WHOOP membership, and a
[WHOOP Developer App](https://developer.whoop.com) with the redirect URL
`http://localhost:3000/callback`.

```bash
npx -y whoop-ai-mcp@latest setup --client=claude-desktop
```

**Set up. Authorize. Ask.** Enter your app credentials, then fully quit and reopen
Claude Desktop. Authorize WHOOP in your browser on first server start and ask:

> **"Summarize my sleep and recovery this week."**

Optional telemetry defaults to **No**. No global npm installation is needed.

For Claude Code, Codex or Copilot, use `--client=claude-code`, `--client=codex` or
`--client=copilot`, then run the registration command setup prints.
[Full setup and configuration](references/installation.md).

## Your Data, Your Choice

**Read-only WHOOP access. Local by default. No hosted relay required.**

Health results reach the assistant provider you configure. Aggregate mode limits
disclosure to five summary tools; it is not anonymization. Usage telemetry is
off by default and requires consent; it never includes health data or chat text.
Opted-in tool failures use fixed coarse categories without raw error messages,
response bodies or identifiers.
See [data handling](references/privacy.md) and [telemetry controls](references/telemetry.md).
