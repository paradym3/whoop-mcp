**whoop-ai-mcp** is a read-only [WHOOP](https://www.whoop.com/) [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Codex and GitHub Copilot. Ask about your recovery, compare weeks of sleep, or check today against your own baseline, without exporting the data yourself.

```bash
npx -y whoop-ai-mcp@latest setup --client=claude-desktop
```

</p>

## Ask your WHOOP data anything

| Ask | You get |
|-----|---------|
| **"How am I doing today?"** | Recovery, primary sleep, strain and your latest workout, with gaps flagged where data is missing |
| **"Is my HRV unusual for me?"** | Your personal baseline: distribution, percentiles and how many days it's based on |
| **"How did my sleep change this month?"** | Trends, period-to-period comparisons, sleep debt and consistency |
| **"Give me my weekly health review."** | Recovery, sleep and training in one summary |

Statistics describe your recorded history. They aren't medical diagnoses or predictions.

## Quickstart

**You need:** Node.js 20 or later, an active WHOOP membership, and a [WHOOP Developer App](https://developer.whoop.com) with the redirect URL `http://localhost:3000/callback`.

1. **Set up.** Run the command for your assistant and enter your developer app's client ID and secret when asked.

   | Assistant | Command |
   |-----------|---------|
   | Claude Desktop | `npx -y whoop-ai-mcp@latest setup --client=claude-desktop` |
   | Claude Code | `npx -y whoop-ai-mcp@latest setup --client=claude-code` |
   | Codex | `npx -y whoop-ai-mcp@latest setup --client=codex` |
   | GitHub Copilot | `npx -y whoop-ai-mcp@latest setup --client=copilot` |

   For Claude Code, Codex and Copilot, run the registration command that setup prints. Nothing is installed globally, and optional usage telemetry defaults to **No**.

2. **Authorize.** Fully quit and reopen your assistant. The first time the server starts, WHOOP opens in your browser so you can approve access.

3. **Ask.** Try *"Summarize my sleep and recovery this week."*

Need manual configuration, environment variables or a remote deployment? See the [full setup guide](references/installation.md).

<br>

The [Rust implementation](https://github.com/shashankswe2020-ux/whoop-mcp-rs) supports the same four assistants without a Node.js runtime. It needs Rust 1.88 or later:

```bash
cargo install whoop-mcp
whoop-mcp setup --client=claude-desktop
```

## How it works

<picture>
	<source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="images/readme/how-it-works-dark.svg">
	<img src="images/readme/how-it-works-light.svg" width="100%" alt="Your WHOOP account grants read-only access to whoop-ai-mcp, which runs on your computer with 16 read-only tools and no hosted relay. It sends tool results to your AI assistant: Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Codex or GitHub Copilot.">
</picture>

- **Read-only.** The server has no tools that create, change or delete anything in your WHOOP account.
- **Local by default.** The server runs on your machine. No hosted relay is involved.
- **Your assistant sees the results.** Health data reaches the assistant provider you use, the same as anything else you share in that chat.
- **Aggregate mode** limits the server to five summary tools and hides per-record data. It reduces what's shared, but it isn't anonymization.
- **Telemetry is off unless you opt in.** It never includes health data or chat text.

Details: [data handling](references/privacy.md) and [telemetry controls](references/telemetry.md).

## What's included

In standard mode, the server provides **16 read-only tools, 4 resources and 5 prompt templates**. Support for resources, prompts and remote connections depends on your assistant.
